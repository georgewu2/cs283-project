Poisson Image Editing
=============

The goal of this project is to implement some features under the umbrella of Poisson Image Editing and to analyze their performance on specific images. Specifically, the features I explored were:

1. Seamless Cloning
2. Seamless Cloning with mixed gradients
3. Texture Flattening
