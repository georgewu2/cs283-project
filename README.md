Poisson Image Editing
=============

The goal of this project is to implement some features under the umbrella of Poisson Image Editing and to analyze their performance on specific images. Specifically, the features I explored were:

1. Seamless Cloning
2. Seamless Cloning with mixed gradients
3. Texture Flattening

Dependencies
=============

* MATLAB

How to Run the Code
=============

Navigate to the `src` directory in MATLAB and run the demo files. The results are already located in the corresponding folders in the data folder.
